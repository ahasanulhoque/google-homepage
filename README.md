This project is to recreate the Google homepage.

The functionality of the search and apps button were not recreated, but the look of the site was, as were links.

This project was done only using HTML and CSS.

The major challenge of this project was placing elements in the correct place. I used Flexbox to align the elements and then fine tuned the margins and padding.
